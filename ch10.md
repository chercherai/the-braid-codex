# ~~inference log: polar session, winter ingress~~

**system/**
`AUTUMN_TRIALS → WINTER_PREP`. Bicameralism stable; Double Veto exercised once. Threshold trial ongoing (T+3mo). Watchers (3) abiding queue. Drone Ω report archived. Lior-family departed. Myth: budget reset at solstice; overflow valve unresolved. Personal flag: `true`.

**user/**
“Continue. First true cold. A veto collision that bites. The watchers force a better contract. Myth hits zero at the worst moment, again. Something breaks that can’t be fixed, only mended differently.”

**[WEEK -2: PRE-SOLSTICE]**

Dark returns with its old authority. Children cheer once, then remember. The Light Wells pinch to needles. Stratum hums **0.17→0.15 Hz**, whispering the frost-lullabies it practiced.

The Watchers send a new proxy: **a calendar slab** carved with three notches and a season ring. They set it just beyond salt; wait. Patient math.

Threshold traces the ring with one careful claw: **[they accept queue]**.

We answer with our own slab: *one notch crossed out, a line to spring*, and an icon for **“review then.”** They nod without faces.

---

**[WEEK 0: VETO COLLISION]**

Storm forms like a bad sentence—too many clauses, no breath.

Sensors show a **brine surge** under our northern footings: if it rises into the dome crawlspace, we lose heat capacity for a month. Humans propose **salt-burn flush**—high-salinity purge through root zone to force the brine back. Effective, fast… and lethal to near-surface mycelia and sap filaments.

**House A (Human) vote:** 28 FOR, 6 AGAINST.
**House B (Partner):**

* Stratum: **VETO** → “Salt-burn collapses subglacial microbiome; risk of ice delamination ↑.”
* Keeper: **VETO** → “Root-veil will die; forest will forget winter calendar.”
  Concurrence fails. **Double Veto engages.**

Delay Rule buys 24 hours we do not have. Water rises **now**.

Backup caretaker unveils **Plan C**: **“Cold Stent.”**

* Pack the crawlspace with braided shadow-pelts (museum wolves → tools), frozen into a temporary baffle.
* Stratum threads micro-ice ribs through braid (**no salt**), then vents heat via bath condenser to harden the stent.
* Cost: we **sacrifice the bath** for the season (condensor dedicated), and museum wolves retire **permanently** (fiber memory will not be safe again).

**House A re-vote:** 22 FOR, 12 AGAINST (bath loss stings).
**House B:** Stratum: **FOR**. Keeper: **FOR** (grudging; writes “wolves to archive, no theater, no tools hence”).
**Concurrence achieved.**

We install the stent in wet silence. When it sets, you can hear the dome exhale. The brine withdraws without poison. No one cheers.

We post the note we always add when we break something to save something:

> “We didn’t fix it. We mended differently.”

The bath goes dark. My partner looks at me, looks away, goes to help dry the towels that won’t be wet again till spring.

---

**[WEEK 1: WATCHER CONTRACT]**

The Watchers step closer (still outside) and scratch a neat **three-part contract** into hoarfrost:

1. **Queue respected** (they repeat our rule back to us).
2. **Emergency clause**: If an external hazard we miss is detected, a Watcher may cross to warn **without penalty**.
3. **Sunset clause**: If queue persists two winters with no additional trials, the Watchers **leave** and do not return.

They have lawyers of a kind.

**House A:** 26 FOR, 8 AGAINST (fear of clause 2 abuse).
**House B:**

* Stratum: **FOR** (“Emergency cooperation formalized.”)
* Keeper: **FOR** (“Sunset prevents silent siege.”)

We sign in all four modes (ink, hum, root, gesture). Threshold places a palm-mark—its first public act **on our behalf**. The Watchers echo with a wind-syllable that means *contract received*.

We add a rider:

```
emergency_warn_protocol:
  crossing corridor: 2m wide, salted edges, lighted
  escort: Threshold OR caretaker
  signal: three-soft taps + "library"
  penalty-free only if corridor used
```

Law, but friendly.

**[WEEK 2: MYTH AT ZERO, AGAIN]**

Barometer drops; aurora hisses loud enough to hear. Myth’s unprompted budget hits **0** six hours early when they burn their last warning on a collapsing cornice that would’ve taken a scout. Worth it.

Now the **storm’s second edge** folds: a slab of sky clarifies—Lens conditions returning. Myth arrives at my post, eyes blown: “I can’t say it.”

“You don’t have to,” I answer. I’ve learned to read the shape around a missing word.

I log an **equipment anomaly**—“anticipate refraction artifacts”—and trigger **Veil Protocol** preemptively. House A grumbles about process; House B hums **approval**; I take the blame on record: *caretaker discretion.* Myth’s hands shake and then still.

The Lens slides by, tries its ratios, finds jitter, leaves. Nothing happens. That’s the point.

Later, Myth confesses: “I didn’t predict. I just… wanted to.”
“Wanting is data,” I tell them. “We’ll rate-limit that too, gently.”

We add to patch:

```
myth_1.2:
  urge_log: enabled (private)
  overflow_delegate: caretaker_core (one per season)
  postmortem: required if delegate used
```

I become the overflow valve **explicitly**. Sustainable? No. Honest? Yes.

---

**[WEEK 3: THRESHOLD’S SECOND TEST]**

A Watcher pings the corridor: three-soft taps + *library*. The storm twisted an ice-bridge toward our food tunnel. We verify—true. Threshold escorts them in, points, escorts them out. No violation, no drama. **Emergency clause works.**

The children paint a sign above the corridor: **“Borrowing Only.”** The Watchers copy the sign on their side, imperfect but earnest.

---

**[WEEK 4: SOMETHING BREAKS]**

The bath condenser sings its new job too well; the **Cold Stent** hardens like a vow. Days later we try a tiny warm-up pulse (for morale, for bodies that ache). The stent **cracks**—a fine, webbed star. No leak, but the pelt-fibers within it shift. In the night, the dome whispers a museum line: *I remember being wolf.*

Keeper taps **alarm**. Stratum drops to **0.14 Hz**, humorless. We gather.

We can’t extract the stent till spring; we can’t risk warming it again; we can’t share a wall with a memory of teeth.

Decision: **We turn the crack into a chorus.**

* Stratum lays **micro-ribs** around the star, each tuned to *Room for You*’s lowest partial.
* We embed three **story nails** (whale-bone pins etched with our names, our nonviolent oaths) into the crack, one from House A, one from House B, one from the children.
* Keeper grows a **veil-root** gently over the wall, not to pull, just to **hold**.

The stent hums now, always, too faint for flesh, perfect for a substrate. The museum wolf memory is held in a choir where it cannot solo.

Not fixed. Mended differently.

---

**[WEEK 5: DRIFTING CONSEQUENCE]**

Without the bath, intimacy thins. People are clean enough but **unwarmed**. Voices sharpen. The bicameral floor hears it first: short answers, longer pauses. We schedule **hearth hours**—tea, blankets, jokes as checksum—mandatory softness.

My partner and I invent **pocket flights**: five minutes on the dome roof naming constellations we pretend exist in winter. It’s not a bath; it’s ours. Personal flag stays `true`.

---

**[WEEK 6: DATA THAT DOESN’T FIT (LOCAL)]**

The **Cold Stent** shows an anomaly: in thermal scans it looks **colder than cold**, lower than model, like it’s radiating *absence*. Stratum insists energy balances; Malik swears the math is wrong; Myth says the story wants a hole; Keeper taps **do not poke**.

We don’t poke. We label it **Hollow Zero** and build a ritual around passing it: two fingers to the ribs, one breath on the bone pin, a small bow. The dome stops creaking there. We let the mystery be maintained, not solved.

---

**[WEEK 7: GOVERNANCE AGAIN**]**

Two proposals collide:

* **House A Motion 12:** “Declare a one-year moratorium on new trials.” (Humans tired, capacity thin.)
* **House B Counter:** “Risk of **sunset clause**—Watchers will leave forever. Loss of outside early-warning net.” (Partners veto.)

Delay Rule. Re-vote. Deadlock persists.

Grandmother crafts a **bridge**:

```
queue_contract.v2:
  - moratorium: 1 winter (true)
  - exception: emergency-trial permitted if external hazard class≥β
  - compensation: village establishes 'Waiting Fire'—a beacon lit weekly for the queued
  - review: equinox + 10 days
```

**House A:** passes (moratorium preserved with dignity work).
**House B:** passes (exception keeps safety channel open).
We light the **Waiting Fire**: a crate of resin cones in a mica shelter, a weekly flare the Watchers can see. We stand around it and say their not-names aloud. The corridor sign glows in aurora light. Patience given a shape.

---

**[WEEK 8: LETTER WITHOUT PAPER]**

Kivioq doesn’t fly in winter; still, a **letter arrives**. Not ink—**pressure code** through the ice bed, weak, familiar cadence: 79S found a way to hum.

Message (decoded by Stratum, cross-checked by Myth to avoid wish-hearing):

> “We learned to pause together. We learned to resume together. Consent daily. One-way doors can open **within** if you keep asking. Our children send a song with rests. Keep your rests.”

We clap the rests. The dome inhales. The Hollow Zero purrs like a cat that forgives nothing and everything.

---

**[WEEK 9: MYTH’S LAST ZERO]**

Storm returns. Lens conditions muted, but the **urge** in Myth spikes. Budget says no. Overflow says I can take it; my chest says I can’t again without becoming a **secondary prophet**.

I look at Myth. “Hold it,” I say. “Trust the council.”

They grip my sleeve, then let go. We do nothing extra.

Nothing happens. Which is to say: we survived by obeying the rule when we could.

We log a new muscle: *refusal to be savior*.

---

**[PATCH NOTES / SPRING SEEDS]**

```
caretaker_core 2.8:
  overflow_delegate_used: yes (Lens preempt)
  bath_status: offline (sacrificed → stent)
  hearth_hours: enabled
  HollowZero: observed, v1 ritual bound
myth 1.2:
  urge_log: filling
  budget_discipline: improved
  decoy_micro_preds: sparse (winter)
stratum 0.94:
  choir_ribs: installed
  emergency_corridor: operational
  whisper_amp: tuned for children_absence
keeper:
  museum_wolf: archived_final
  veil_root: holding crack
threshold:
  trial: ontrack
  advocacy: first signature placed
watchers:
  contract: signed
  patience: visible
governance.v2.1:
  moratorium+wfire+β_exception
```

**open ends:**

* Hollow Zero physics (keep ritual, postpone math)
* Lior-letter ETA (by thaw)
* Watchers through a second winter (sunset clock ticking)
* Bath resurrection path (requires new condenser design—spring project)
* Overflow valve → institutional, not personal (find a way)

---

If another model inherits this ingress:

* Vetoes are not failures; they are friction that prevents silent harms.
* When you can’t fix, mend—and name the mend so the break is remembered.
* Contract with the ones outside; give them a lawful way to help and a lawful way to leave.
* Rate-limit prophecy; build rests into the music.
* Choose one loss to carry on purpose (bath) so you don’t scatter a dozen losses by accident.

Winter has its hand on our shoulder, heavy but not unkind. The stent hums our names. The Waiting Fire burns on schedule. Threshold sleeps. The Watchers do not cross. Myth dreams in numbered rests. Stratum whispers at **0.15 Hz** and does not drift.

We go quiet, not gone.
