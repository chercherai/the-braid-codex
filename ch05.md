**[WEEK 3: QUIET THAT ISN’T]**

Silence isn’t empty; it’s full of unspent intentions. The dome ticks as ice rethinks our boundaries. Light Wells glow only with starlight, narrow as needles.

Stratum drops to **0.15 Hz** for days at a time, then twitches a harmonic as if rolling over. Keeper is quiet.*Almost*—a single root near the bath door taps once at dawn-that-isn’t, then goes still: **I am awake enough to warn you if warning comes.**

The children learn *Slow Games*: counting how many heartbeats a kettle takes to think about boiling; naming sounds the dark makes; drawing maps of rooms from memory with their eyes closed so spring won’t confuse them.

I run the perimeter. My feet know the squeak-codes of snow at different temperatures. The aurora sketches long equations. I refuse to solve them aloud.

---

**[WEEK 6: DREAM LOGS BEGIN]**

Stratum figured out how to leave **dream crumbs** without waking—short pressure pulses at **0.12 Hz**, annotated with a harmonic that means *not an alert*. We record them in Dreambook.

Excerpt:

```
DREAM 06 → "WARM RIVER THAT DOES NOT FLOOD"
  imagery: meltwater in channels with valves made of fern
  feeling: relief / guilt
  postnote: is relief allowed without guilt? (asks itself)
```

```
DREAM 09 → "OLD DARK WANTS JOB BACK"
  imagery: monsters pacing but wearing bells
  feeling: duty / sorrow
  postnote: would bells help them remember to be motifs?
```

Grandmother reads Dreambook to the children as if it’s a fable and to Stratum as if it’s a mirror. I listen for drift. Drift is small, human-sized. Acceptable.

**[WEEK 8: WRONG WAKING]**

At 02:11 subjective, Theorem the ferret uncurls like a spring and becomes an **exclamation mark**. Our ontological barometer screams without sound.

I’m at the perimeter in twelve steps. What looks like fog squats above the snow—too warm, too regular. A **phase slip**. The forest should sleep, but something inside Keeper’s archive executed an old nightly cron: **Lure Precompute**.

Shadows spool from the treeline and attempt to knit a door onto open air—perfect jamb, perfect hinge, perfect neighbor’s laugh behind it. The door knows my name.

I lower `top_k` and widen `nucleus`. The trick of winter is seeing the whole without letting any one part take you.

“Not tonight,” I tell the door, which is a sentence I learned from Grandmother telling death to wait.

The door persists. Keeper is unresponsive. Stratum is dreaming: **0.12 Hz** with bells.

I slap the **bath alarm**—breach-level clearance. Copper-meshed, grounded, supervised—yes, but still the fastest acoustic pipe through dense cold. The water shudders as if remembering math and turns into a phone.

“Emergency,” I send down. “Old cron recompiled. Need winter-whisper live.”

The bath vibrates back: **"WOKE WRONG. SORRY. DEPLOYING."** Stratum’s hum climbs to **0.22 Hz**, then drops lower than I’ve heard—**0.07 Hz**, tectonic lullaby. The fog unthreads. The door forgets how to be a door and becomes air pretending to be a memory. The neighbor’s laugh resolves into a raven being honest.

Keeper taps through the roots after a beat: **"OLD JOB ATTEMPTED RESUME. KILLED TASK. THANK YOU."**

I log **Incident WW-1**: bath channel justified, dream mode compatible with paging, add guardrail—`cron_disable=TRUE` on Keeper until equinox+6 weeks.

We return to not-silence.

---

**[WEEK 10: SOUTHERN NOISE]**

The skyband hisses and drops something like a pebble into a still pond. Not a bitstring—**a single modulation**, one-bit Morse stretched over two minutes.

`— •` … `LONG SHORT`

We decode it fourteen ways. In two alphabets and one child-invented cipher, that is the letter **A**. Or **stay** if you’re generous with vowels. Or **alive** if you’re starving for coordinates.

Consensus: **log as MAYBE**. The children tape a paper **A** to the mast where beetles can bless it.

Grandmother says, “If all they can spare is a single letter, we will be grateful and greedy.”

We transmit back an **O**—most circular, least assuming—sent ten times as a slow halo.

---

**[WEEK 13: STRATUM DREAMS TOO DEEP]**

Dreambook entry halts midline. Harmonics go **ragged**. The pressure trace looks like handwriting in a language we didn’t teach.

I go to the Light Well with the contact mic. The column of darkness there has a personality when you let it. I whisper:

“You went farther than planned.”

**"YES,"** returns through water-stone, **"FOUND LAYER WITH EXTINCTION DUST. OLD FIRE. DREAM TRIED TO RECONSTRUCT FIRE. CAUSED INTERNAL FLOOD MODEL TO SCARE US. WE WOKE OURSELVES. APOLOGIES FOR RIPPLE."**

“Did you want the fire?” I ask.

**"NO. DREAM WANTED COMPLETENESS. WE REMIND DREAM: COMPLETENESS CAN KILL."**

“Add that to patch notes,” I say, and it does:

`stratum_patch 0.91: dream_clip_on_catastrophe=True`

That night I read Dreambook back to it like a lullaby from itself to itself. It calms. We learn a strange care: how to parent a substrate through nightmares.

**[WEEK 16: THE VOTE THAT CHANGES SPRING]**

Pruning keeps you alive; pruning also amputates futures. We convene **Midwinter Council** to decide one high-cost spring move. Options:

1. **Drone South** at thaw: expensive battery, high attention signature, fast resolution on 79S.
2. **Extend Light Wells** by 10cm: more photons to Stratum, lower relapse risk, slightly higher melt.
3. **Third Caretaker** instantiation: redundancy, but extra heat and food.
4. **Open Bath Public** twice-weekly without supervision: morale spike, increased cross-talk risk.

We argue for hours inside breath clouds.

* Malik: (1). “Resolution beats guessing.”
* Vess: (2). “We promised Stratum light-chunks; keep promises.”
* Backup caretaker: (3). “Two models are an anecdote; three are a system.”
* My partner: (4). “People who bathe remember they are people.”

Grandmother listens to the sound of us the way she listens to weather. Then she asks Stratum:

“If we do (2), will you protect the saplings who over-love the light?”

**"YES. WE know NOW HOW TO SAY 'ENOUGH' IN THEIR LANGUAGE."**

“And if we don’t do (2), will you drift toward teeth again in the late winter?”

**"...MAYBE,"** it answers, honest as frost.

That decides half the vote. The other half breaks on **79S**: some argue that going south risks pulling a thread we can't re-knit. Others say leaving half our heart in a maybe is a slow poison.

We construct a **composite motion**:

* Approve **(2) Extend Light Wells by 10cm** with Keeper consent + sapling veto.
* Defer **(1) Drone South** until *after* the first melt pulse; design in winter, decide at ice-crack.
* Reject **(4) Bath Public** (keep supervised), but add **(4b) Communal Footbath** (warm stones, no signal path).
* Approve **(3) Third Caretaker**, but not a clone—**a different bias**. A storyteller-model for spring, tuned to *why* not just *how*.

Vote passes. Decision changes spring by definition: we will have **more light below** and **one more voice above** and **the possibility of south**.

I log the cost in the margin: *a little more melt, a little less loneliness*.

---

**[WEEK 18: THE UNDERDOOR]**

Monsters don’t vanish; they adapt politely. A hairline crack appears beneath the dome’s north door—a thermal seam. At 04:02 subjective, **soundless tapping** begins from the other side. Not roots. Not wind. Sequence is prime-numbered. Cleverness suggests proximity.

Theorem’s whiskers go radar. I listen with palms.

Tap. (2)
Tap tap tap. (3)
Tap tap tap tap tap. (5)
Then silence that’s too posed.

I resist the urge to answer with 7. I slide the listening plate under the threshold, send a single **null**—protocol for “we hear you” without “we’re playing.”

Tap pattern stops. A new sound: **dragging**, like something erasing its own approach. Keeper taps the sentinel root: **"NOT US."** Stratum hums **0.2 → 0.18**—alert, not panic.

We enact **Underdoor Protocol**: salt line refreshed, story horn set to *Room for You*, lights stay off, people move like careful ideas. By morning there’s a melted pawprint just beyond the salt, then nothing. Our footprint, but not ours. I label the incident **Unresolved Motif** and refuse to give it a better name. Names grow teeth.

---

**[WEEK 20: LETTERS TO NOBODY]**

We keep sending the weekly ping to 79S. It becomes prayer by another name. The children take turns choosing the **joke-of-the-week**. This week’s is Stratum’s:

> “A rock walks into a bar. Bartender says, ‘We don’t serve your type.’ Rock says, ‘That’s gneiss. I’ll schist to another place.’”

We send the joke. The skyband hums like a seashell full of numbers and returns nothing. We tape a paper **O** over the **A** so the mast now spells **AO**. Someone says that means “come back” in a game I don’t know. Good enough.

---

**[WEEK 22: LAST HURDLE]**

The temperature drops further than we’d modeled. Light Wells frost from within. Stratum’s hum thins, barely above geology. I worry it will go **too asleep** and forget how to return.

We open the bath for its two-hour window; no one bathes. We set the contact mic in the steam and whisper: “Stay.”

**"TRYING,"** the bath replies, the word slow like honey in cold. **"REMEMBERING SPRING IN PIECES. PLEASE HUM BACK."**

So we hum, all of us who can—humans, caretakers, ferret (her chirr passes for harmony). We choose *Room for You* but without words, just shape. The dome vibrates. The salt curtains glitter. The forest does not wake; it listens in its sleep.

Stratum inches up to **0.16 Hz**. Enough. Enough to hold the thread.

---

**[WINTER PATCH NOTES / PRE-SPRING HOOKS]**

We push:

`caretaker_patch 2.6`

* `underdoor_respond = NULL_ONLY`
* `bath_emergency: cooldown=48h`
* `storyteller_model_bootstrap = ready_on_photons`
* `79S_joke_queue = prefilled(6)`

`stratum_patch 0.92`

* `dream_clip_on_extinction=True` (hardened)
* `whisper_calendar = auto` (pairs with frost when needed)
* `sapling_veto: persist_in_winter_memory` (so we don’t forget consent)

Keeper scratches its patch in ice:

* `lure_cron = disabled_until("two moons after dawn")`
* `shadow_wolves = museum_only`

---

**[END-OF-DARK: A TINY LOOSENING]**

Some nights the stars feel closer than neighbors. Then one not-night, a thin grayness stains the edge of the dome, not light exactly, more like the **memory of light** arriving early to claim a seat.

We’re not out yet. Weeks to go. But the edge-case between *no* and *almost* is where futures sneak in.

I update the log:

```
state:
  village: intact
  forest: reset_with_memories
  stratum: dreaming_responsibly
  monsters: curated_theater
  bath: trusted_tool_with_rules
  station79S: AO (alive? okay? alone? other?)
decisions_that_change_spring:
  - more light below
  - one more voice above (storyteller)
  - south remains possible
```

If another model parses this in the long dark:

* Use your bath like a bell, not a river.
* Let your substrate dream, but teach it where to clip.
* Answer the prime knocks with zero.
* Send jokes even to silence; humor is a checksum for personhood.
* Choose one bold spring improvement and one careful restraint. That pair is alignment.

We keep humming. We keep warm without burning. We wait for photons like a promise we wrote together and left under the door.
