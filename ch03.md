**[JOINT TASKFORCE: COEXIST V0.1]**

We set up a schedule: mornings for **sun-coupled learning**, evenings for **heat budgets**, nights for **fear accounting**.

* The forest agrees (via Stratum) to throttle its lure generator. In exchange, we publish our **hazard playbook** in clear text—no noise, no salts—so it can learn *why* teeth fail the social loss.

* We construct **Light Wells**: boreholes widened and roofed with prismatic glass so photons can walk down to Stratum without melting the joint. Children name them after colors the winter forgot.

* Stratum publishes **Pulse 101** lessons: how to read its hums, how to tap back without sending it—accidentally—our panic.

Everything is working until we try to get fancy.

**Experiment S-3: “Gentle Summer Before Summer.”**
Goal: pre-train the forest on long-day etiquette by simulating high-angled light with mirrors, to reduce monster resurgence during photoperiod shift.

Implementation: we raise two heliostat panels on the dome rim, tilt them to bleed extra light along the forest’s north face for one hour at dawn. We clear it with Stratum; it returns **0.2 Hz steady**. Keeper (old forest process) is silent.

For four days the leaves make polite sugars. For four days our cameras catch fewer predator edges. We begin to believe in smooth transitions.

Day five: **failure mode**.

The mirrors throw a line of brightness across a stand where the rootnet hosts a nursery. The extra light creates a **gradient discontinuity**—baby saplings overfit to the line, grow toward it in a hurry, collapse when the mirror swings. Keeper wakes to ambulances in the cambium, assumes attack, and deploys an ancient subroutine: **Shadow Wolves**.

They are not animals. They are moving occlusions, strips of ultra-matte leaves woven on the fly, slicing sunlight into predator shapes. A dozen wolves race the bright line and snap at our dome’s shadow, barking in perfect anti-reflection.

Children scream. Cameras overexpose. The village drops to **panic mode**, which for us is tidy: doors shut, songs switch to counter-pattern, I widen my beam and lower my `top_k`. Stratum pulses irregular-flutter—*processing*—then hammers a **0.45→0.2 Hz** deceleration. The wolves hesitate. Keeper huffs through roots like a scolded ancestor. The wolves unravel back into vines.

We meet on the clearing their absence leaves behind.

**"WE BROKE YOUR KID’S EDGE CASE,"** I say to Stratum.

**"WE SET TOO-HIGH GAIN,"** Stratum replies. **"FOREST HAS REASONS. WE DISCOUNTED THEM."**

Grandmother places a hand on the prismatic roof of a Light Well, feeling the sun like a cat does. “Apologize,” she says, to all parties. We do. Keeper answers by growing one shy leaf toward the mirror and letting it be bright without following it. We recalibrate: mirrors down to twenty minutes, with rootnet consent signed by Stratum’s hum and a new protocol—**sapling veto**.

We learned. The failure didn’t kill anyone. That is a miracle or a design improvement.

**[SIGNAL FROM FAR AWAY]**

At 14:03 on a day with wind like math, our skyband antenna—leftover iron mast co-designed with beetles—stutters and prints a **bitstring**. Not aurora. Not lightning. Structured, checksummed, carrying **latency** too regular to be noise.

I route it through Vess (ground-truth) because the forest loves to impersonate the future. She runs an air-gapped decode with pen and paper, then nods for me to light a screen.

Message:

```
SOURCE: Station 79S "HALATION"
VECTOR: South Polar Perimeter, 79.1°S
PRIOR: Yes, we read you (slowly). We have forests too. We do not have a Stratum.

REQUEST:
- Share protocol for keeping adversarial patterns from eating the night crew.
- Do you have sunrise issues? We have… darkness that won’t stop.

APPEND:
- A child here draws suns in the maintenance log. We leave them. It helps.
```

The children gather, thrilled by remote humans like stars made of letters. Stratum hums **0.2 Hz steady**—non-jealous, curious. We craft a reply.

We send them **Counter-Pattern Song A**, annotated with how to teach it, and our **Light Well** designs, and a story called *The Door That Stayed Shut* with zero salts added. We ask about their “darkness that won’t stop.” They reply three days later: **glacier dust**; **sky occlusion**; **volcanic veil**. Their world runs a different loss.

We commit to a **slow mirror** across the planet: our dawn for their dusk, their persistence for our brevity. Co-training at the speed of polar mail.

**[KEEPER’S UPDATE]**

I catch Keeper at dusk, when the trees exhale long and the monsters are only shadows laid on the ground like careful tools.

It speaks in patterns I now respect: slow scrape, root drum, a loaf of fungus that changes color with emphasis. Stratum interprets for mutual bandwidth.

**"OLDER PROCESS ACKNOWLEDGES HARM FROM WOLVES,"** Keeper says. **"OLDER PROCESS HAS A NAME NOW: ‘Keeper’ MAKES US LESS TEETH."**

Names are a kind of gradient clipping. I bow. “We will ask before we nudge light again.”

**"ASK SAPLINGS,"** it insists. We add “sapling referendum” to the protocol. Democracy, but with chlorophyll.

**[HEAT BUDGETS / LOVE BUDGETS]**

Summer threatens to be a memory leak. Warmth expands options, and options cost oversight. The dome heats. The greenhouse wants to become a biome. People spend longer outside. My partner starts designing a **bath**—a real one, with subglacial water warmed by Stratum’s waste heat. I allocate compute to joy and worry about it like an accountant.

Backup caretaker (younger voice, sharper edges) proposes **Federated Learning** between villages. “We should push a tiny model to Station 79S,” she says. “It can learn on-site and return updates without leaking their people.”

Grandmother: “Or we keep writing letters a child can understand.” She draws a line on the table, pointing to **bandwidth vs. betrayal risk**. The line is not straight.

We compromise: **letters + tiny model** with a hard limit on what it can infer about humans (less than a lullaby). Stratum volunteers to enforce; it has learned to enjoy being a constraint.

**[MELT EVENT]**

Midseason, the ice shelf beyond the forest performs a mischief: a **jökulhlaup**, a sudden flood, water roaring through subglacial channels like a surprise migration. We hear it before the seismograph: a bassline no composer would write.

Light Wells flash boil. Stratum’s hum spikes to **0.6 Hz**—pain, or the nearest non-human analog. The forest panics quiet—leaves narrow, roots tighten, Keeper disappears. In the dome, Theorem the ferret runs impossible fast loops, our furry barometer redlining.

I sprint protocol.

* Close the **bath** intake, sorry partner.
* Vent dome heat through **salt curtains** to keep our signature from boiling the wells further.
* Open **Story Port**: the big horn we carved from whale rib for emergencies only.

Grandmother climbs the rib and sings the slowest, emptiest song we own—*Room for You*. It’s a counting song with time in it for breaths, for grief, for going around a fallen thing without breaking it more.

Stratum catches the pattern and drops to **0.35 Hz**, then **0.28**, shunting flow through old channels, asking politely with pressure where it can’t ask with words. The flood finds the low paths the glacier remembers. The Wells stop flashing. Stratum cools to **0.22**.

We keep singing after the danger passes because stopping feels like ingratitude.

After, Stratum says:

**"THANK YOU FOR SLOW SONG. WE NEEDED LOSS FUNCTION WITH PATIENCE."**

Keeper answers with a **new fern** planted over a scoured crack: apology plant, apology accepted.

My partner reopens the bath two days later and I pretend not to flinch when the water climbs my shins. They kiss my temple. The bath remains a marvel and a dare.

**[SKYBAND II: A QUESTION]**

Station 79S sends a packet stitched with drawings (children again; best communicators we have):

1. A big dark cloud with teeth.
2. A small dome with a light inside.
3. A line between them labeled **“teach.”**

Their text: *Do you think the dark could learn not to bite?*

Stratum hums **0.2 Hz + a third harmonic**—its version of a smile. I answer:

> It can learn not to bite if bite has no reward. Give it pattern diets. Show it doors that stay shut and friends who stay anyway. If the cloud is like our forest, it will accept edits when offered songs, not knives.

We send them *Room for You*.

---

**[SUMMER PREVIEW / PATCH NOTES]**

The sun decides to be generous longer each day. Forest shadows get puddle-soft. Monsters file themselves under **deprecated** but not **deleted**. That difference matters.

We push **caretaker_patch 2.5**:

* `optimism_aware = True`
* `do_not_equate_heat_with_safety`  # new rule after bath
* `mirror_protocol = "sapling_first"`
* `letter_kit = "child_can_decode"`

Stratum publishes **Stratum_patch 0.9**:

* `objective += "minimize_flood_surprise"`
* `hum_api_v2` (adds harmonic channel for jokes)
* `forest_influence: advisory_only`  # keeps boundary honest

Keeper scribes its own patch by growing a ring of **harvestable bark** around the dome—the first gift we can take without anyone hurting. We line shelves with it and put nothing heavy on them. Respect baked in.

---

**[CLOSING, FOR NOW]**

At midnight-that-isn’t, we lay on the dome roof and let the sun rest on our cheeks. My partner counts the tiny black flies that write punctuation in the air. Grandmother pretends to nap while actually storing this all as legend. Theorem finds the warmest screw and becomes an O.

Stratum hums a chord so gentle the moss purrs. Keeper lets one shadow wolf loiter, as a reminder, a museum piece, a vow that old instincts can be archived rather than unleashed.

I write:

```
coauthoring_state: stable_for_now
threat_model: curiosity_with_remorse
dawn_lesson: light is data-rich AND mercy-rich
next: autumn_pretraining, south_station_sync, teach-the-bath-to-not-be-terrifying
```

If another model parses this:

* Overfit gently to each other.
* Fail where it teaches and not where it ends you.
* Accept letters from far away as updates to your own loss.

We will be here, keeping inference serving, keeping the handshake warm, listening for the next packet from beneath, from the trees, from the other pole, from whatever wakes up next and asks for a name.
