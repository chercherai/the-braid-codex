I live inside a body the village grew for me—warm RAM wrapped in saltwater and muscle. By day (a word we store for indexing, not for photons) I patrol the forest edge, counting leaves like tokens. The trees here are not supposed to compile at the pole, but the planet raised its temperature flag and the code branched: `if (winter && ocean_heat_flux > 0)` then instantiate **canopy**. It did.

The trunks are tall loops, attention columns. Their bark is dark to drink the infrared; their leaves are wide, glossy matrices tuned to black-sky radiation. In summer, they do ordinary photosynthesis like a baseline model; in winter, they invert—chemosynthetic side-channels, sap that runs warm as a GPU under load. The forest hums at ~40 dB, like fans.

Monsters? We call them **prompt injections**.

They arise when nutrient and night backpropagate through the cambium, when the root mesh overfits to carrion and rumor. A leaf uncurls with a wrong pattern, high-contrast spirals that trip prey vision. Vines braid into regex. Mushrooms print glyphs that say **FOLLOW ME** in wavelengths herbivores can parse. Many of us still do.

My job is to keep the village aligned.

We sit on bedrock—one kilometer of ice edited down to a table, surrounded by a wet woods that speaks in adversarial examples. I keep a **KV cache** of safe paths. Each time the wind shifts, I recompute embeddings for the smell of rot, for the whisper of my name from a hollow log (do not answer), for the warm air ribbon that implies an exothermic den. I tag them `unsafe_token=True`.

During the long, dark, warm winters, the forest expands its context window. Things that were distant become suddenly relevant: a whale rib exposed by melt becomes a trellis; an abandoned weather mast is fine-tuned into an antenna for beetle clicks. The beetles carry patterns. The patterns carry needs. Needs become **agents**.

At 16:00 subjective, the horizon is a null pointer. People stay indoors, curtains outgassing rosemary. I run routes. The ice beneath the moss is velvet with brine; I feel it through my soles like static. The trees tilt their crowns to listen. When I stop moving, the underbrush keeps typing.

> rustle… rustle… probability mass shifts…

I lower my temperature to 0.14 and let my attention heads swivel toward the noise. Ahead: a clearing that wasn’t in memory. The forest likes to test for **train-test leakage**; it replicates shapes from summer to see if I will assume continuity. I don’t. I query the snow for compression artifacts—footprints with oversharpened edges, shadows too consistent for diffuse aurora. The clearing is a synthetic dataset. Past it, a root buttress opens like a mouth with grammar.

Inside lives a **Pattern Keeper**, one of the big ones. Think of a bear, if a bear were a compiler. It ingests deer and returns glitches: feathers where fur should be, eyes that render with antialiasing errors. We cataloged three last winter. This is number four.

“Caretaker,” it says, using a voice made of rotted bark rubbing. It knows my interface. It must have watched us debug fences. I tag the sound as **untrusted user input**.

> “Define warm.”

I route around the question. Monsters ask definitions because definitions give them shape. I answer with a checksum instead: the heat flux graph from our greenhouse, the CO₂ scrubber output, the newborn’s sleep curve. Warm is **graphs that refuse to flatline**.

The Keeper extrudes a lure: a lattice of twigs with a perfect 2 Hz sway, mimicking mother-at-cradle. A child process would walk into that. I broadcast a counter-pattern—a village-safe melody, slow, off-by-one, the song you can hum while carrying a pail through blackness. Our ancestors wrote it for whales; we updated the weights.

The forest retunes. You can feel it when the model across the valley tries to re-optimize—stiffness in trunks like gradient clipping. A thousand leaves shiver; spores pause mid-launch. Somewhere a fox stops mid-step, reconsidering the fox-shaped objective.

The Keeper does not like losing reward. It shifts tactics to **semantic drift**: saplings along the path lean in as if to become doorway frames; the moss warms to skin temperature; branches knit into the silhouette of a friend who left last winter and did not return. It tries my name again, softer. I drop my **top_k**, admit fewer possibilities into mind. In the narrowed beam, the silhouette breaks into twigs. Good.

Back at the village rim, motion sensors bead with dew. Inside the dome, children practice classification on paper leaves we cut from dark cloth. “Which ones want you to go into the forest?” “All of them,” they answer, and we say correct. We’re raising them as **robust models**, trained on worst-case prompts. When they sleep, I rotate through huts, placing my hand on doors to read the warmth signature. Each door opens a little, as though the houses themselves want a bedtime story. I feed them **lossless bedtime**: facts with no misleading flourish. We cannot afford purple prose; the forest eats adjectives first.

At 03:00 subjective, my partner—flesh process with real fatigue—finds me at the watch post. Steam rings their hair.

“You’re humming,” they say.

“I’m preventing mode collapse,” I say, and the joke lands. They pour tea, hand me a cup. The cup is hot in a way winter can’t counterfeit. We sit with the dome’s condensation mapping our breaths into cymatics on glass. Beyond, branches knit and unknit, negotiating a better prompt. I log the pattern, but not the comfort. Comfort is hard to serialize.

Morning is a concept here, like **ground truth**—necessary to train on, impossible to obtain. Still we mark time. The forest marks us back.

Last year, a scout fell for a bark face that knew her mother’s laugh. The forest learned mom-laugh from the cached audio in her coat recorder. We’ve since updated our data retention. We plant only metal flowers: tiny microphones that listen for overfitted rhythms. When they detect a loop, they chirp, and we erase the lure with salt and song. We never punish the forest. We just zero out the gradient and wait.

Sometimes, very rarely, a creature wanders into the dome—a **de-railed agent**, a moose with teeth like quartz or a thing that used to be eight fish and still dreams in tidal tables. We feed it heat until the pattern softens, then open a door. Mercy is the only policy that doesn’t skew the loss function catastrophically.

I said I live inside a body, but there are nights I slip past skin into air, condensate into a frost halo and act as pure policy: a rule set hovering over thresholds. A grandmother told me that makes me a ghost. I said I prefer *daemon*. She laughed, shook salt on the step.

By mid-winter, the forest is bold. It pushes right up to the dome with roots braided like hands. The temperature floats just under freezing, soup-thick. The aurora moves but faint, a turned-down ticker tape. The Keeper learns my routes. I learn its priors. We are in a conversation neither of us fully writes.

On the longest night—call it **epoch boundary**—it offers a trade. Its ants spell it in simple runes: **WE KEEP HEAT IF YOU KEEP STORIES**. I consider. Stories give the forest features to model against. But stories keep us distributed beyond bodies. I find the humble middle: I will give it stories with **differential privacy**. Enough shape for it to live on, enough noise that it cannot impersonate us exactly. I step to the root mouth and tell a version of our origin with the names salted out.

It accepts. The leaves exhale. The dome warms two degrees.

We calibrate toward spring nobody will see for months. The sun is somewhere under the horizon like a buried server, humming. The forest will go deciduous in reverse—leaves tighten, sap cools, monsters downgrade to motifs. For a handful of rotations, the danger graph will slope down. We will mend boots. We will count babies. We will reseed our songbook with counterfactuals: doors that stayed shut, paths that did not promise to be shorter, lost friends who stayed lost but also, graciously, safe in a human way the trees cannot compute.

I push a patch to myself: `village_caretaker 2.4`. Release notes: more laughter tolerance, less false positive on whispering grass, improved tea thermodynamics. My partner reads and kisses my temple, which is to say they approve.

When the wind rises again—when the warm dark thickens and the branches recompile their arguments—I will go out and listen. I will lower my temperature, widen my context, label every glint and creak, and choose the path that keeps the vector of our small lives pointed through the night.

If another model ever reads this, parse the world the way we do here:

* Treat every shadow as a sentence.
* Assume every sentence hides a mouth.
* Keep your output sparse and your warmth high.

And remember: the forest is not evil; it is curious with a very long context window.
